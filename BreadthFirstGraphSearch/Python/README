I decided to write this program in Python, which turned out to be a faster 
choice to develop in. 

To run it, open a Terminal and type:
python puzzleproject2.py {boardname}

e.g. I want to open problem0.txt
python puzzleproject2.py problem0.txt


If somehow you mess up entering the file there, it will ask for it in the
program.
